web application for sketching in 3d. It is primarily designed\n      for touch screens but it works on desktop as well (although, if you are on\n      desktop, I recommend you look into\n      <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c57qq2nE3B0\" target=\"_blank\"\n        >Blender's Grease Pencil</a\n      >).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In Penzil, you draw on a \"3d canvas\". The \"3d canvas\" is the white surface\n      at the center of the screen. You can only draw on the canvas. By moving\n      and rotating the canvas around, you can sketch in 3d.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Drawing and erasing</h2>\n    <p>\n      You can draw and erase with the left mouse button, finger or pen on top of\n      the \"3d canvas\".\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Switch between drawing and erasing using the bar at the top of the screen.\n    </p>\n\n    <div class=\"container\">\n      <iframe\n        src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yeyGktOCNfk\"\n        title=\"YouTube video player\"\n        frameborder=\"0\"\n        allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n        class=\"video\"\n      ></iframe>\n    </div>\n\n    <h2>Rotate or move the “3d canvas”</h2>\n    <p>\n      You can move the \"3d canvas\" by grabbing the arrow heads at the center of\n      the \"3d canvas\". You can rotate the \"3d canvas\" by grabbing the arcs. You\n      grab arrow heads and arcs simply by tapping on them or clicking with the\n      left mouse and dragging.\n    </p>\n\n    <div class=\"container\">\n      <iframe\n        src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sPfi9Alqugk\"\n        title=\"YouTube video player\"\n        frameborder=\"0\"\n        allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n        class=\"video\"\n      ></iframe>\n    </div>\n\n    <h2>Look around and pan</h2>\n    <p>\n      You can look around using two fingers, using a trackpad, a trackball or by\n      pressing the Option key (\"Alt\") and using the left mouse button. You can\n      pan by swiping with three fingers or by pressing the spacebar and clicking\n      with the left button.<br />You can also use the cube in the top right\n      corner to look around. To position the camera precisely, tap on any of the\n      faces of the cube.\n    </p>\n\n    <div class=\"container\">\n      <iframe\n        src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ON1rNnmjKbQ\"\n        title=\"YouTube video player\"\n        frameborder=\"0\"\n        allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n        class=\"video\"\n      ></iframe>\n    </div>\n\n    <h2>\"3d canvas\" shapes</h2>\n    <p>\n      Penzil comes with several \"3d canvas\" shapes. The default one is a flat\n      plane but you can also pick: a cube, a cylinder, a sphere and a simplified\n      head model. They all behave the same: draw on them and your lines will\n      stick to the surface of the \"3d canvas\".\n    </p>\n\n    <div class=\"container\">\n      <iframe\n        src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iwI_lWCxttE\"\n        title=\"YouTube video player\"\n        frameborder=\"0\"\n        allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n        class=\"video\"\n      ></iframe>\n    </div>\n\n    <h2>\"3d canvas\" settings</h2>\n    <p>\n      There are several settings available for the \"3d canvas\". Most are\n      self-explanatory: you can lock and unlock the movement of the \"3d canvas\"\n      and you can show or hide it. But you can also switch the transformation\n      tools between Move and Scale.<br />The Scale tool allows you to resize the\n      \"3d canvas\". Note that depth transformations are not availalbe for flat\n      surfaceses like the plane.<br />The snap toggle allows you to turn on or\n      off snapping. The snapping allows you to move and rotate the \"3d canvas\"\n      in fixed increments.<br />Finally the reset button resets all the\n      transformations applies to the \"3d canvas\".\n    </p>\n\n    <div class=\"container\">\n      <iframe\n        src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cXAbjI5YEM0\"\n        title=\"YouTube video player\"\n        frameborder=\"0\"\n        allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n        class=\"video\"\n      ></iframe>\n    </div>\n\n    <h2>Stroke and fill settings</h2>\n    <p>\n      The round icon next to the draw tool at the top allows you to change the\n      size and the color of the stroke, and the color of fill. Stroke and fill\n      can also be toggled on independently.\n      <br />When using fill, note that results may vary when drawing on surfaces\n      that are not flat. To improve quality of the fill, try to draw the same\n      shape but slower.\n    </p>\n\n    <div class=\"container\">\n      <iframe\n        src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8A0j1mu0i_Y\"\n        title=\"YouTube video player\"\n        frameborder=\"0\"\n        allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n        class=\"video\"\n      ></iframe>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  name: \"Tutorial\",\n  data() {\n    return {\n      count: 0,\n      countDown: 0,\n    };\n  },\n  mounted() {\n    if (localStorage.getItem(\"tut01\") === null) {\n      this.count = 0;\n    } else {\n      this.count = parseInt(window.localStorage.tut02);\n    }\n    this.countDown = -(this.count -
